# Uncertainty Matrix

This repository includes an example computation for the uncertainty matrix, described in the paper titled:  
```Visualizing Diagnostic Uncertainty in Tabular Data: An Information-Theoretic Matrix Approach```, presented in IEEE VIS 2025, Uncertainty Visualization Workshop.

The repository does not have example data. The data used in this work comes from a cardiology hospital, and it is highly sensitive.
